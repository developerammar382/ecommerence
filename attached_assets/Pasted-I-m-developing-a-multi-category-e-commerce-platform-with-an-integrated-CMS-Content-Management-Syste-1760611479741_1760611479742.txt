I’m developing a multi-category e-commerce platform with an integrated CMS (Content Management System) for easy content updates and a fully functional role-based admin dashboard.

Tech Stack:

Backend: Python

Frontend: Vue.js

The platform will support a wide range of product categories, including but not limited to:

Clothing, shoes, and accessories

Groceries and daily-use items

Electronics and gadgets

Home and kitchen products

Health and beauty products

One of the key features will be a 3D virtual try-on experience for wearable products (e.g., clothes, shoes, glasses). Users will be able to upload their photo or use their camera to try products virtually.

🧑‍💼 Admin Panel Features

The admin panel will be role-based, supporting multiple user types:

Super Admin

Product Manager

Content Editor

Customer Support

Additionally, it will include AI-powered tools for:

Inventory management and demand forecasting

Automated product recommendations

Smart content suggestions (e.g., product descriptions, SEO tags)

Customer behavior analytics and insights

🧠 User-Side Features

AI-powered chat assistant for support, product recommendations, and order tracking

Personalized shopping experiences based on browsing and purchase history

Secure payment gateways and multiple shipping options

Mobile responsive and SEO-optimized design

Scalable architecture with future mobile app integration (Android & iOS)

🚀 Current Progress

I’ve already completed Version 1 of the website and admin panel with the basic structure in place. The backend and CMS are functional, and the foundation of the frontend is set up.

🎨 Frontend Development Task

Your task will focus on enhancing the frontend to make the website more professional and visually appealing. Specifically:

✨ Redesign and polish the UI with a clean, modern, and consistent design system.

🖼️ Implement a sliding image hero banner on the homepage for better product presentation.

🧭 Use high-quality images and icons instead of emojis to give the platform a premium look.

📱 Ensure the design is fully responsive across all devices.

🧰 Build the remaining pages for both the website and the admin panel.

🎨 Choose and implement a professional color scheme that looks elegant and enhances readability.

🖼️ Improve overall user experience (UX) — smooth transitions, clean typography, proper spacing, and visual hierarchy.

🌟 Goal

The final design should feel like a modern, scalable e-commerce platform — fast, clean, user-friendly, and visually impressive. It should be on par with major e-commerce brands in terms of presentation and professionalism.
