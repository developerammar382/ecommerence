## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework: Vue.js 3 with Composition API**
- Uses the modern Composition API pattern with `<script setup>` syntax for component logic
- Vite as the build tool and development server for fast hot module replacement
- Component-based architecture with lazy-loaded route components for optimal performance

**State Management: Pinia**
- Centralized state management using Pinia stores instead of Vuex
- Separate stores for different domains:
  - `auth.js` - User authentication and role-based access control
  - `cart.js` - Shopping cart operations and persistence
  - `products.js` - Product catalog and category management with icon components
  - `orders.js` - Order history and tracking
  - `wishlist.js` - User wishlist functionality
  - `admin.js` - Admin dashboard data and analytics
- State persistence using localStorage for cart, wishlist, and user session

**Routing: Vue Router 4**
- Client-side routing with lazy-loaded components
- Route guards for authentication (`meta: { requiresAuth: true }`)
- Nested routes with MainLayout wrapper for consistent UI structure
- Hash-free history mode for clean URLs

**UI/Styling: Tailwind CSS**
- Utility-first CSS framework with custom configuration
- Custom color palette defined:
  - Primary: Purple gradient (50-900 shades)
  - Secondary: Teal gradient (50-900 shades)
  - Accent: Orange gradient (50-900 shades)
- Reusable component classes defined in `@layer components`:
  - `.btn-primary` and `.btn-secondary` for gradient buttons
  - `.input-field` for form inputs
  - `.card` and `.card-hover` for content containers
  - `.gradient-text` for text gradients
  - `.badge-*` for status badges
- Responsive design patterns with mobile-first approach
- Custom animations: fade-in, slide-up, bounce-slow

**Component Libraries**
- Headless UI for accessible, unstyled UI components
- Custom SVG icon components in product store for categories
- Chart.js with vue-chartjs wrapper for data visualization in admin dashboard

**Key Components:**
- `HeroBanner.vue` - Auto-sliding carousel with 5 slides, navigation controls, and gradient overlays
- `ProductCard.vue` - Enhanced product display with wishlist, virtual try-on, and cart integration
- `MainLayout.vue` - Responsive layout with improved header, footer, and navigation
- `ChatBot.vue` - AI-powered customer support assistant
- `VirtualTryOn.vue` - 3D virtual try-on feature for wearable products

### Backend Architecture

**Data Layer: Mock Data with localStorage Persistence**
- Currently using in-memory mock data stored in Pinia stores
- Client-side persistence via localStorage for:
  - Shopping cart items
  - Wishlist items  
  - User authentication session
- Products, categories, and initial data hardcoded in stores with 21 products across 7 categories

**Authentication & Authorization**
- Mock authentication system with predefined user roles:
  - Super Admin (full access)
  - Product Manager (inventory and product management)
  - Content Editor (limited access)
  - Customer (standard user)
- Role-based access control through computed properties (`isAdmin`, `isAuthenticated`)
- Session persistence in localStorage
- Route protection via navigation guards

**Data Models**
- **Products**: id, name, price, category, categoryId, image, description, stock, rating, reviews, featured
- **Categories**: id, name, slug, icon (emoji), iconComponent (SVG function)
- **Cart Items**: product data + quantity
- **Orders**: id, date, status, total, items[], shipping{}
- **Users**: id, name, email, role, status, joinDate
- **Admin Stats**: sales metrics, dashboard statistics, inventory alerts
