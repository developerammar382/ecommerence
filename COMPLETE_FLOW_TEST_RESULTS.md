## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED**

### Priority 1: Fix ProductDetail.vue
Add null checks for product data:
```javascript
// Line ~352: Change from
product.price.toFixed(2)
// To
(product?.price || 0).toFixed(2)
```

### Priority 2: Fix ProductCard.vue
Add optional chaining for all product properties:
```javascript
// Use ?. operator for all nested properties
product?.name || 'Unnamed Product'
product?.price || 0
product?.image || '/placeholder.png'
```

### Priority 3: Restart Workflow
The admin store fix needs a workflow restart to take effect.
